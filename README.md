# My React implementation of the classic learner's project, a to-do list.

## Description
An assignment I did for The Odin Project. A lot of students find this one tough and I was no different! At first testing felt like it was mostly getting in my way, but by the end of this I developed an understanding of why it's important.

Moreover, the cycle of writing tests and making them pass helped me cement the git workflow in my mind. Before this project, I was making wild commits with huge, sweeping changes. This is maybe the most important thing I picked up with this one, and it's made my work a lot more ordered and maintainable.
